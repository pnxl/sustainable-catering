# Sustainable Catering

Taking action for sustainable catering practices.

## The problem?
**Single-use, non-biodegradable food containers.**

Catering services use single-use plastic containers and disposable cutlery to serve food. While this is convenient â€” this practice contributes a significant amount to environmental pollution and creates a big waste of plastic.

## The solution?
**Proper silverware and reusable, washable containers.**

Using food containers for catered meals that can be collected, washed, and reused for future meals.

For people who eat at the canteen, the food could be served on proper silverware that can be washed after use.
